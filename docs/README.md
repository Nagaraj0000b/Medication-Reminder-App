## üèÅ How to Run

1. Clone the repo and navigate to the project folder:
git clone https://github.com/Nagaraj0000b/Medication-Reminder-App.git
cd Medication-Reminder-App


2. Set up your MySQL database:
- Create a database (e.g., `medication_reminder`)
- Run the SQL scripts in `/docs` or as provided in the README to create the required tables (`users`, `medications`, `reminders`).

3. Configure your database connection:
- Update `server/db.js` with your MySQL credentials.

4. Install dependencies in the `server` folder:
cd server
npm install

5. Start the backend server:
npm start
The server will run at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

6. Test the API:
- Use Postman or curl to test endpoints like `/medications` and `/reminders`.
