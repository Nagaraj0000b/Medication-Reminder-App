## 📝 Notes & Best Practices

- Always use `return` after sending error responses in Express to prevent further execution.
- Commit and push changes after every major step for better version control.
- Keep `node_modules` and `.env` files out of version control by using `.gitignore`.
- Use forward slashes (`/`) in file paths for MySQL commands on Windows.
- When importing the database in MySQL Workbench, do **not** use the `SOURCE` command—use the GUI import instead.
