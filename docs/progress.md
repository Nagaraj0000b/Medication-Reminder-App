## 📝 Notes & Best Practices

- Always use `return` after sending error responses in Express to prevent further execution.
- Commit and push changes after every major step for better version control.
- Keep `node_modules` and `.env` files out of version control by using `.gitignore`.
- Use forward slashes (`/`) in file paths for MySQL commands on Windows.
- When importing the database in MySQL Workbench, do **not** use the `SOURCE` command—use the GUI import instead.
- For dashboard UI, use Tailwind’s flex utilities and responsive classes to maintain alignment across devices.

## 🚧 Next Steps

- 💊 Implement medication supply alert widget (low pills warning).
- 🖼️ Integrate pill database search and image support in Add Medication form.
- 📱 Continue refining dashboard widgets (adherence stats, next dose, etc.).
- 🧪 Add frontend unit and integration tests.
- 📚 Expand documentation for new features and user flows.
